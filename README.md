# Orders API

Simple API that manages placement of orders. It also supports voucher handling.

</div>

## Installation

The project can be installed and run using *Docker* and *docker-compose*.
To install *Docker*, visit its [official page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
And to install *docker-compose*, follow [these steps](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
To help manage the project and execute commands in an quicker way,
there is a set of [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) targets already configured.

Set up and run the project just by running one of the following sets of commands:

```sh
make start
```

or

```sh
sh docker/setup.sh
docker-compose build --pull --no-cache
docker-compose up --detach
```

## Documentation

There two endpoints that provide the API documentation, after running the project. We use Swagger and OpenAPI
specification.

Interactive documentation:

```text
/doc
```

JSON documentation:

```text
/doc.json
```

#### There is also a [Postman collection](./docs/postman_collection.json) already set up.

#### The current API's database model is represented in this [ER diagram](./docs/er_diagram.png).

## Useful tips
